	fiction novels, then think again. Robots are the largest growing technological device in the world. They perform many 
	functions ranging from space exploration to entertainment. Robotics technology is increasing at a fast rate, providing us 
	with new technology that can assist with home chores, automobile assembly and many other tasks. Robotic technology has 
	changed the world around us and is continuing to impact the way we do things. Robotic technology transformation from the 
	past to present surrounds almost everyone in today’s society and it affects both our work and leisure activities. <p>

	<p>	Robotics is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the 
	design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for, their coptrol and processing.
	These technologies deal with automated machines that can take’the place of a human in various kinds of work, activities, 
	environments and processes. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on 
	investigations into new types of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture 
	them.<p>

 <h2>Music </h2>

	<p><img src="music.jpg" alt="Picture of Music note" width="350" height="250">Sounds are all around us, from birds chirping and waves lapping against a coastline to cars honking in traffic. But 
	sometimes sounds are put together in purposeful ways to create a specific atmosphere or to express ideas or emotions. Such 
	organized sounds are called music. Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of 
	putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition. People who make music 
	creatively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven symphony or one of Duke Ellington's jazz songs. Music is 
	made of sounds, vibrations, and silent moments, and it doesn't always have to be pleasant or pretty. It can be used to 
	convey a whole range of experiences, environments, and emotions.<p>
	
	<p>Music is the sound of our soul. It is expression of man’s soul. The following paragraph mentions meaning, value and importance 
	of Music in our Life, in simple words for students. Music is one of the most important and powerful things in our lives. It has 
	the ability to affect our emotions, thoughts, and physical well-being in a variety of ways. While its impact can be felt in 
	every aspect of our lives, music is especially important in our personal and emotional development. Simply defined, music is an 
	art form consisting of sound and silence expressed in time. Music can be heard, felt, or even seen. It is incredibly diverse, 
	spanning all cultures and genres. There is no one right way to experience it, and everyone has their own unique connection to 
	it. Music has been around for centuries, and its importance has only grown over time. It is a vital part of our culture and 
	society, and can be found in all aspects of our lives. Apart from all, Music is an important tool for 
	learning and understanding new things. It can help us in a variety of subjects, from maths and science to history and 
	literature. It can also help us develop our creative skills and imagination. It helps us express ourselves and find our 
	identity. It can be a way to connect with others who have similar interests and values. It can also provide us with a sense of 
	belonging and community. It can help us deal with stress, pain, and sadness. It can also give us a sense of hope and optimism. 
	Music can inspire us to achieve great things. It can give us the motivation to work harder and reach our goals. Music is 
	the expression, thoughts and feelings. It has had a profound impact on every field of our life. 
	From blessing our souls with comfort and ease to making our environment pleasing, music has an impact everywhere. <p>

 <h3 id="about">About</h3>
 <p id="about">My name is Daunte Robertson, I am a  Computer Science major at UWI and in the future id like to go into Robotics, 
 mainly the software section because I like when I can do something intangible and notice a tangible result. I am a quiet 
 person who tends to think alot about things, I try to look at situations from different perspectives to try and understand 
 the same idea from different views.</p>
